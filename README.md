# Edgeless Browser

![Edgeless Logo](./assets/Edgeless%20Logo.png)

Edgeless Browser is a browser that is built on top of the electron framework and uses the solidjs library for the front end. The browser is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use. The browser is being built to be a more privacy focused browser that is secure and minimalistic. The browser is being built by Hasan and is open source so feel free to contribute to the project.
